        <p>I'm a highly independent sofware builder with a generalist background, forged as a professional during an almost constant economic crisis.</p>
        <p>I read and understand complex code fast. I can easily adapt to new contexts, domains, tools and codebases. I can shape and deliver projects with specific budgets and deadlines, working alonside domain experts to understand tradeoffs. I can design and adapt processes and rituals for teams looking to build great products fast.</p>
        <p>I find joy in writing simple code, mentoring and, more recently, in playing the piano 🎹.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Designed and implemented a usage-based subscription billing system featuring payment gateway integrations (Stripe &amp; MercadoPago), internal accounting and debtor management</li>
          <li>Rearchitectured referral flows with +100M daily background jobs to reduce that number by 70%, increase system observability and allow easy recovery after outages</li>
          <li>Refactored all core models of a referral platform to adapt legacy code to a new architecture, involving some tables with +300M rows</li>
          <li>Shaped, reviewed and managed projects with different budgets, restrictions, in very different domains</li>
          <li>Led the launch and production of five 3D printer models in less than 5 years, period in which the yearly inflation rate was about 30% and the argentinean peso was one of the weakest currencies in the world</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Apr 2023 - Current. SparkLoop</strong></p>
        <p>SparkLoop makes the leading newsletter referral tools for creators and media companies looking to grow their email-lists faster and more affordably.</p>
        <p>I'm leading a team of amazing devs deliver projects faster and better, shaping projects but also reviewing code and mentoring, heavily influenced by Shape-Up. In this hybrid position, I also focus on identifying bottlenecks and removing them, either by implementing new rituals or by refactoring code to keep the codebase in good shape.</p>
        <p><strong>Jun 2020 - Dec 2022. Nulinga (~ 2.5 years)</strong></p>
        <p>Nulinga is an e-learning platform that offers language learning solutions to corporate clients.</p>
        <p>Spent my first year as a full stack developer, then took some projects as a tech lead. I could also spend part of my time helping scale the team without having to resign the joy of coding. That was, thinking and reading basically, but also using what we learned to interview, select, help onboard and mentor other team members. Heavily influenced by 37signals and the Shape Up approach to product development.</p>

Helped raise funding and launch 5 printer models in a very short period with an almost continuous economic crisis. We also launched a customer focused digital manufacturing business unit.</p>
